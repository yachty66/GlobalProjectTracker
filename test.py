Lets write some python code. I could do an eyperiment where I use a ipynb my daily notes. Plain Python is not such an advantage because I cannot do markdown. I am happy actually because I can spend all my time now to there where my real passion is. Computation. I can read endless papers and books about it - I am so happy about that.
